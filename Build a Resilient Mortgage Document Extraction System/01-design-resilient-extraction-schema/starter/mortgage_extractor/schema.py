"""JSON Schema for mortgage document extraction.

The schema is a single canonical structure spanning all three document types
(loan application, appraisal, income verification). Per-document-type extractor
tools share these properties but differ in their ``required`` lists.

Nullable fields use the union-type idiom (``type: ["<base>", "null"]``) so the
model can return ``null`` for absent fields rather than fabricating values.
Categorical fields that may grow over time use the ``enum + "other" + *_detail``
pattern: when none of the enum members fit, the model emits ``"other"`` and
writes a free-text reason into the sibling ``_detail`` field.

    """Return the canonical JSON Schema for mortgage data extraction.

    The schema is an object with four top-level sub-objects: borrower,
    property, loan, and income. Each sub-object has its own ``properties`` map
    and ``required`` list. The top-level ``required`` list names the
    sub-objects that must always be present.

    Design rules for this schema (these are the LO):

    1. A field that is reliably present in the document goes in the relevant
       sub-object's ``required`` list and has a plain ``type: "<base>"``.
    2. A field that is often absent uses the nullable union idiom:
       ``type: ["<base>", "null"]`` and stays out of ``required``.
    3. A categorical field whose value space will grow over time uses an
       ``enum`` ending in ``"other"`` and is paired with a sibling
       ``*_detail`` string field that captures the free-text spillover when
       the model emits ``"other"``.
    4. Per-document-type ``required`` lists (set by ``tools.doc_type_extractor``
       at extraction time) override the schema's top-level required list. Mark
       only what every document type carries here at the schema level.
