"""Anthropic tool definitions for the mortgage extraction pipeline.

A "tool" in the Anthropic Messages API is a JSON object with a ``name``,
``description``, and ``input_schema`` (JSON Schema). When the API returns a
``tool_use`` content block, its ``input`` is guaranteed to validate against
this schema, which is how this project enforces structured output.

The canonical extractor tool, :func:`extract_mortgage_data`, will be registered
for the second pass of the pipeline in Exercise 2. The classifier tool,
:func:`classify_document`, will be registered for the forced first pass. Both
share the schema you build in :mod:`mortgage_extractor.schema`.
