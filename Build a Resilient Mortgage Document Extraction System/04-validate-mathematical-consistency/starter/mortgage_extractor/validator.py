"""Mathematical-consistency validator.

The extractor pulls two redundant values from any line-itemized total: the
``calculated`` sum (computed in Python from the per-component fields) and the
``stated`` total (extracted verbatim from the document). When the document is
internally consistent these agree; when they don't, the discrepancy is
surfaced for human review rather than silently corrected.

The default tolerance is one dollar — small enough to catch real arithmetic
errors, loose enough to absorb cent-level OCR rounding that upstream document
conversion sometimes introduces. Override per-call when a domain demands
zero-tolerance or a percentage-based threshold.
